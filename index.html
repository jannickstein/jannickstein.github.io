        <h1>Jannick Stein</h1>
        <h2>Hi, I’m Jannick.</h2>
        <p>I’m Chief of Staff at Ledgy. I’m the Founder of Chiefs Of Stuff. I’m a Generalist.</p>
        <p>Generalists run the world. The best founders of companies, movements, and societies are all generalists. They share ambition, curiosity, and, most importantly, versatility in an ever-changing world.</p>
        <p>I share my musings on technology, generalists, and beyond in my newsletter (coming soon) and in shorter form on Twitter.</p>
        <p>Before joining Ledgy, I learned from incredible founders in my first generalist role at Acapela. Previously, I worked at venture firms such as Global Founders Capital and b2venture. I graduated from the University of St. Gallen with a BA in Business Administration.</p>
        <p>I grew up in northern Germany and now live in London. I love coffee, chess, and drumming.</p>
        <p>I like to meet new people, especially if you’re opinionated. I respond to Twitter and LinkedIn DMs.</p>
