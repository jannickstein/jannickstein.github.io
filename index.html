                <p>Hi, I’m Jannick.</p>
                <p>I invest in exceptional founders pre-idea and pre-team to help them build US-first startups from scratch at <a href="https://www.joinef.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Entrepreneurs First</a>.</p>
                <p>I believe <a href="https://www.generalism.blog/p/the-generalist-edge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">generalists run the world</a>. They embody ambition, curiosity, and, most importantly, versatility. I've founded a community called <a href="https://chiefsofstuff.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Chiefs Of Stuff</a>, where we're hosting events and connecting generalist operators across Europe and the US.</p>
                <p>Prior to EF, I scaled teams and processes at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/podcast/ledgy-a-carta-for-european-startups-to-manage-equity-and-cap-tables-raises-22m-from-nea-sequoia-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ledgy</a>. I cut my teeth working across strategy, business, revenue operations, finance, and people. I ended up being the company's first Chief of Staff.</p>
                <p>I was also a member of the founding team of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/acapela/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Acapela</a>, a platform reimagining how we communicate at work.</p>
                <p>I grew up in Germany, currently live in London and spend time in SF too. I love coffee, chess, and drumming.</p>
